			<p>The Hippopotamus, scientifically known as Hippopotamus amphibius, is an iconic semi-aquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa
				with their massive size and barrel-shaped bodies, Hippos spend much of their time submerged in water to keep cool and protect their
				sensitive skin. Despite their herbivorous diet of grasses and vegetation, they are known for their aggressive nature,
				especially when defending their territory or young. Despite their formidable appearance, hippos are social animals, often
				congregating in groups known as pods or bloats. However, habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict pose significant
				threats to Hippopotamus populations across Africa.
